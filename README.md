# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project involves developing a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The application is designed to help users predict stock prices based on historical data, which includes features like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Dividends, Stock Splits, Ticker, and Adjusted Close prices.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following components:
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing and preparing the stock market data.
- **Model Development**: Building and training the LSTM model.
- **Application Deployment**: Creating an interactive application to use the trained model for predictions.

## Files in the Repository

- `app.py`: The main application script to run the web interface.
- `model.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the model development and training process.
